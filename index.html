      <h2>About Me.</h2>
      <h3>Born to teach (and learn!)</h3>
      <div class="profile">
        <p>With being a naturally chatty, extroverted (ENFP for any MBTI fans out there), working with, learning from, and teaching others aren’t just things I find rewarding and engaging – they’re essential to who I am as a person. Whilst I can (and do) often chat a lot, I’ve also learned over the years how to become a better listener and to let others do the talking. I’ve nurtured this not only through engaging in conversations with people who have totally different perspectives than me (sitting next to a more conservatively minded person at work was great practice for developing tolerance and understanding!) but also by teaching English online to international students from completely different backgrounds to me and encouraging them to speak their minds as much as possible.

<p>
  I love learning, I love being around people who are learning, and I love helping others to learn. This is one of the reasons I got into teaching, and another reason why I’ve so thoroughly enjoyed F&C meetups. Through teaching English online in my spare time over the last few years, I’ve taught English to students from countries such as:
</p>
<h3>Brazil, China, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Kazakhstan, Poland, Russia, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sudan, Syria, Taiwan, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, Venezuela, and many more!
</h3>
<p>I never cease to be amazed by the range of diversity in thought and speech as I’ve seen from these students, no matter what their beliefs and backgrounds, whilst still witnessing that same “human spirit”, for lack of a better term, and eagerness to learn within every one of them. I truly believe it is this love of learning and curiosity which unites us all as a species. I’ve been successful as a teacher by being offering a welcoming and non-judgemental space; making them feel more confident in speaking in the process. You can see my teaching profile and some of my student’s reviews <a href = "http://www.italki.com/teacher/4381777">here</a>.

      <h3>The quest for ethical coding</h3>
      <div class="profile">
        <p>Over the years, the more I logged into social media, the angrier I became. I felt as though I was being manipulated by the things I read into feeling angry all the time. Knowing what I do now about how Facebook write their algorithms to keep us coming back for more (and keep us divided), I now understand that the way social media managed to keep me engaged was to keep me angry and in debate 24/7. Recent documentaries such as 'The Social Dilemma' further brought this message home for me.

<p>With this insight into the world of unethical coding, a desire to be part of a movement that contributes to making a positive impact in tech, rather than one that manipulates and divides people, has manifested. I say, without the slightest hint of hyperbole, that social media robbed me of my empathy. By abandoning my anger and embracing reason through studying Moral Philosophy (Applied Ethics), where I asked difficult questions as to how to best deal with the social issues I cared about, I was able to gain my empathy back, and use it in a constructive, rational manner.
</p>
<p>Rather than angrily argue with people on social media, I learned how to write and philosophise on how to implement open border policies, climate change solutions, and wealth redistribution. I’m now hoping that by working in an environment so committed to social justice as Founders & Coders I can develop this empathy further – not only improving me as a coder – but also as a compassionate human being who can make a positive, ‘ethical’, impact in tech.

<h3 id = "quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p>Directly below you'll find a random quote generator. The inspiration to build this came from the myriad inspirational quotes I read on the front page of freeCodeCamp during all those hours spent learning JavaScript at the beginning of my journey. I've chosen some of my personal favourites from a variety of thinkers. Sadly, Columbo did not make the list.</p>
