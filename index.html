    <p>Hello and welcome to my <i>new</i> webpage built for my F&C Spring 2021 application.</p>

      <h2>About Me.</h2>
      <h3>Born to teach (and learn)</h3>
      <div class="profile">
        <p>With being a naturally chatty, extroverted (ENFP for any MBTI fans out there), working with, learning from, and teaching others aren’t just things I find rewarding and engaging – they’re essential to who I am as a person. Whilst I can (and do) often chat a lot, I’ve also learned over the years how to become a better listener and to let others do the talking. I’ve nurtured this not only through engaging in conversations with people who have totally different perspectives than me (sitting next to a more conservatively minded person at work was great practice for developing tolerance and understanding!) but also by teaching English online to international students from completely different backgrounds to me and encouraging them to speak their minds as much as possible.

<p>
  I love learning, I love being around people who are learning, and I love helping others to learn. This is one of the reasons I got into teaching, and another reason why I’ve so thoroughly enjoyed F&C meetups. Through teaching English to adult learners online over the last few years, I’ve met, taught, and made friends with students from countries such as:
</p>
<h3>Brazil, China, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Kazakhstan, Poland, Russia, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sudan, Syria, Taiwan, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, Venezuela, and many more!
</h3>
<p>I never cease to be amazed by the range of diversity in thought and speech as I’ve seen from these students whilst still witnessing that same desire and eagerness to learn within every one of them. I have witnessed firsthand that it is this love of learning and curiosity which we all share in common – no matter where we come from or how we think about the world. I’ve been successful as a teacher by offering my students a welcoming and non-judgemental space; making them feel more confident in speaking in the process. You can see my teaching profile and some of my student’s reviews <a href = "http://www.italki.com/teacher/4381777">here</a>.
</p>
<p>I must also give a shout out here to some of the folks who taught me over at Space4 <i>*nostalgic sigh*</i>, who helped me tremendously on my coding journey, as well as to the applicants for this upcoming cohort, with whom I've had the weekly pleasure of sharing the joy of learning to code. I won't name any names (you can never be <i>too</i> sure about GDPR violations) but hopefully they know who they are.</p>

      <h3>The quest for ethical coding</h3>
      <div class="profile">
        <p>My journey into coding is as much driven by my frustration with the state of the tech industry as it is by my interest in it. Over the years, the more I logged into social media, the angrier I became. I felt as though I was being constantly manipulated by the things I read into feeling angry all the time. Knowing what I do now about how Facebook write their algorithms to keep us coming back for more (and keep us divided), I now understand that the way social media managed to keep me engaged was to keep me angry and in debate 24/7. Recent documentaries such as 'The Social Dilemma' further brought this message home for me.

<p>With this insight into the world of unethical coding, a desire to be part of a movement that contributes to making a positive impact in tech, rather than one that manipulates and divides people, has manifested. I say, without the slightest hint of hyperbole, that social media robbed me of my empathy. By abandoning my anger and embracing reason through studying Moral Philosophy (Applied Ethics), where I asked difficult questions as to how to best deal with the social issues I cared about, I was able to gain my empathy back, and use it in a constructive, rational manner.
</p>
<p>Rather than angrily argue with people on social media, I learned how to write and philosophise on how to implement open border policies, climate change solutions, and wealth redistribution. I’m now hoping that by working in an environment so committed to social justice as Founders & Coders I can develop this empathy further – not only improving me as a coder, but also as a compassionate human being who can make a positive, ‘ethical’, impact in tech.

<h3 id = "quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p>Directly below you'll find a random quote generator. The inspiration to build this came from the myriad inspirational quotes I read on the home page of freeCodeCamp during all those hours spent learning JavaScript at the beginning of my journey. I've chosen some of my personal favourites from a variety of thinkers. Sadly, Columbo did not make the list.</p>
