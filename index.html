    <p>Hello and welcome to my <i>new</i> webpage built for my F&C Spring 2021 application.</p>
<p id = "quotes">Directly below you'll find a random quote generator. The inspiration to build this came from reading the myriad inspirational quotes I read on the home page of freeCodeCamp during all those hours spent learning JavaScript at the beginning of my journey. I've chosen some of my own personal favourites from a variety of thinkers.</p>

      <h3>Born to teach (and learn)</h3>
      <div class="profile">
        <p>Being a naturally chatty extrovert (ENFP for any MBTI fans out there), working with, learning from, and teaching others aren‚Äôt just things I find rewarding and engaging ‚Äì they‚Äôre essential to who I am as a person. Whilst I can (and do) often chat a lot, I‚Äôve also learned over the years how to become a better listener and to let others do the talking. I‚Äôve nurtured this by engaging in conversations with people who have completely different cultures, beliefs, and backgrounds to me, largely by teaching English online to international students, but also in my personal life through being curious about other people, their stories, and their worldviews. I'm averse to homogeneity, so I particularly thrive in environments where people aren't afraid to express themselves as individuals. That's one of the reasons why I moved to a bustling place like London, as I felt it was here I could meet a more interesting array [no pun intended] of people, which to me equates to a more fulfilling life.

<p>
  I love learning, I love being around people who are learning, and I love helping others to learn. This is one of the reasons I got into teaching, and another reason why I‚Äôve so thoroughly enjoyed F&C meetups. Through teaching English to adult learners online over the last few years, I‚Äôve met, taught, and made friends with students from countries such as:
</p>
<h3 id ="countries">Belarus, Brazil, China, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Kazakhstan, Poland, Russia, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sudan, Syria, Taiwan, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, Venezuela, and many more!
</h3>
<p>I never cease to be amazed by the range of diversity in thought and speech as I‚Äôve seen from these students whilst still witnessing that same desire and eagerness to learn within every one of them. I have witnessed firsthand that it is this love of learning and curiosity which we all share in common ‚Äì no matter where we come from or how we think about the world. I‚Äôve been successful as a teacher by offering my students a welcoming and non-judgemental space; making them feel more confident in speaking in the process. You can see my teaching profile and some of my student‚Äôs reviews <a href = "http://www.italki.com/teacher/4381777">here</a>.
</p>
<p>It would be careless of me not to give a shout out to some of the folks who helped teach me over at Space4 (<i>*nostalgic sigh*</i> üòî) who helped me tremendously on my coding journey, as well as to the applicants for this upcoming cohort, with whom I've had the weekly pleasure of sharing the joy of learning to code. I won't name any names (you can never be <i>too</i> sure about GDPR violations) but hopefully they know who they are.</p>

      <h3>The quest for ethical coding</h3>
      <div class="profile">
        <p>My journey into coding is as much driven by my frustration with the state of the tech industry as it is by my interest in it. Over the years, the more I logged into social media, the angrier I became. I felt as though I was constantly being manipulated by the things I read into feeling angry all the time. Knowing what I do now about how Facebook write their algorithms to keep us coming back for more (and keep us divided), I now understand that the way social media managed to keep me engaged was to keep me angry and in debate 24/7. Recent documentaries such as 'The Social Dilemma' further drove this message home for me.

<p>With this insight into the world of unethical coding, a desire to be part of a movement that contributes to making a positive impact in tech, rather than one that manipulates and divides people, has manifested. I say, without the slightest hint of hyperbole, that social media robbed me of my empathy. By disarming my anger and embracing reason through studying Moral Philosophy (Applied Ethics), where I asked difficult questions as to how to best deal with the social and moral issues I cared about, I was able to gain my empathy back and use it in a constructive, rational manner.
</p>
<p>Rather than angrily argue with people on social media, I learned how to write and philosophise on how to implement open border policies, climate change solutions, and wealth redistribution. I‚Äôm now hoping that by working in an environment so committed to social justice as Founders & Coders I can develop this empathy further ‚Äì not only improving me as a coder, but also as a compassionate human being who can make a positive, ‚Äòethical‚Äô, impact in tech.
